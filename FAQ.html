						<p class="question">
						How do I get better weapons? (very frequently asked)
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq1" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							You can buy them at any of the purchase boxes placed all over the map. Even outside the outer gates are some some items to buy.
							The currency is gold aka your score which you earn by killing enemies (stronger ones give more score) or completing quests. <br/>
							<br/>
							Not all items are available right away. Some need to be unlocked, for instance the two tents or huts have initially blocked entrances which can be 
							destroyed by either attacking them with your weapons or torches. These items are usually especially useful like the health potions inside the innder hut.
							They allow you carry instantly usable HP restoring potions around, as much as you can buy.
							Purchase boxes usually subtract score in exchange for a certain item but there are two exceptions to this rule. There is a public score box which anybody can
							take money from when somebody else put it some first. It allows to give score to other players.
							The other exception is the knife set, which can be attained at the dining table in the back of the castle (image below). It is the starting set for every class except for Vanguard.<br/><br/>

						<p class="question">
						What items do I keep after death?
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq2" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
						Currently you get back all weapons which you had before you died. Most stat-upgrades like stamina gain, are lost on death. 
						However, there are a few very useful upgrades which you keep like the 400 HP. There is more to come in this regard.
						</p>

					<dt class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq3')" onkeypress="checkEnter(event,'faq3')" tabindex="3">
						<span id="faq3Char" class='MoreLess'>+</span>  
						<p class="question">
						Why do I respawn as a skeleton?
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq3" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							That's what happens when you die and respawn next match. You stay like this for 3 minutes. Just armored with a cudgel but quite speedy and with a special ability: try out pressing F5!
						</p>
					</dd>

					<dt class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq4')" onkeypress="checkEnter(event,'faq4')" tabindex="4">
						<span id="faq4Char" class='MoreLess'>+</span> 
						<p class="question">
						Do I have a disadvantage when joining late?
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq4" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							When you join for the first time in the match and other players already survived for numerous waves they'll have advanced gear whereas you start with beginning equipment.<br/>
							But there is a special score compensation granting players with an initial amount of score depending on the wave. It goes up to 1800 score on normal mode and kicks in for new players joining after wave 5.

						<p class="question">
						How do I spawn? (very frequently asked)
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq5" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							Spawns are only possible after the wave was defeated or before the first wave started.

						<p class="question">
						What is the strongest weapon?
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq6" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							The Treb-sling, shooting catapult rocks. It is offered right next to the normal sling for purchase. Blasts your enemies to oblivion but your vision becomes blurry for 2 minutes after purchase.
							<br/><br/>

					<dt class="FAQ" onclick="toggle('faq7')" onkeypress="checkEnter(event,'faq7')" tabindex="7">
						<span id="faq7Char" class='MoreLess'>+</span> 
						<p class="question">
						How did I get minus score?!
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq7" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							Either you died too often (you get small score subtraction each time you were killed) or you have been a naughty lad, killing your team mates. That costs 100 score and for self kill you loose more score than for getting killed.
							There are plenty of ppl just trying to kill team-mates for the hell of it. But every tk can be punished by the one who got killed with various punishing options. For instance, there is poison, instant kill, burning and whatnot.
							You do need to take care not to die. Especially for beginners it is better to run than taking chances. You get additional score just for surviving each wave.

						<p class="question">
						How many quests are there?
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq10" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							Around 7 or 8 popping up more or less randomly throughout the waves. Some tend to occur more early than others. A complete list with descriptions may be added eventually in an extra section.

						Where can I post suggestions for improving the map?
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq11" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							Please post your suggestions on the Steam-Workshop page of the map. I will have a look at them and may implement them. The map did great progress due to many ppl reporting bugs and submitting suggestions.

						<p class="question">
						I spotted a Hacker!
						</p>
					</dt>
					<dd id="faq12" class="FAA">
						<p class="answer">
							The official Sandcastle Server (currently named "Horde Sandcastle Dev Server") is protected by the banlist all official Chivalry Servers use. 
							It is also possible to include additional bans which I can execute remotely when I'm notified. Otherwise, a link to the cheaters Steam profile can be used to add a ban but NOT the player name alone. 
							So before you report anything to me (commenting on the workshop page), make sure you actually played on my server or banning doesn't make sense.
							That server is also protected with Valve Anti Cheat Technology.
